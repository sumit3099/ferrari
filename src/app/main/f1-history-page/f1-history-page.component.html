        <p>Formula One automobile racing has its roots in the European Grand Prix championships of the 1920s and 1930s, though
          the foundation of the modern Formula One began in 1946 with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's (FIA)
          standardisation of rules, which was followed by a World Championship of Drivers in 1950.</p>
        <p>The sport's history parallels the evolution of its technical regulations. In addition to the world championship series,
          non-championship Formula One races were held for many years, the last held in 1983 due to the rising cost of competition.
          National championships existed in South Africa and the United Kingdom in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

        <p>Formula One was first defined in 1946 by the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) of the FIA, forerunner of FISA,
          as the premier single seater racing category in worldwide motorsport to become effective in 1947. It was initially
          known variously as Formula A, Formula I or Formula 1 with the corresponding "Voiturette" formula being titled Formula
          B, Formula II or Formula 2. When the 500c formula was internationally recognised as Formula 3 in 1950 it was never
          titled as "Formula C" so the three International Formulae were then "officially" titled Formula 1, Formula 2 and
          Formula 3.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, the formula was largely based on pre-World War II regulations defined by engine capacity. The regulation
          expected to bring a new balance between supercharged and normally aspirated cars. Non-supercharged 4.5-litre pre-war
          Grand Prix cars were allowed to race against the pre-war 1.5-litre supercharged 'voiturettes', while pre-war supercharged
          3-litre Grand Prix cars were banned. The first race under the new regulations was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix held
          on 1 September, the race being won by Achille Varzi in an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta.</p>
        <p>Championships for drivers or constructors were not introduced immediately. In the early years there were around 20
          races held from late Spring to early Autumn (Fall) in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant.
          Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo. Races saw pre-war heroes like Rudolf Caracciola,
          Manfred Von Brauchitsch and Tazio Nuvolari end their careers, while drivers like Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel
          Fangio rose to the front.</p>

        <p>The Motorcycle World Championships was introduced in 1949. In 1950, the FIA responded with the first ever official
          World Championship for Drivers. The championship series, to be held across six of the 'major' Grands Prix of Europe
          plus the Indianapolis 500, was in effect a formalization of what had already been developing in Grand Prix racing
          during the previous years. Italian teams of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, and Maserati were best positioned to dominate
          the early years. Other national manufacturers – such as the French manufacturer Talbot or the British BRM – competed,
          although less successfully. A number of private cars also took part in local races. The Italian and German factory
          teams in those days often employed 2 to 3 drivers whose nationality was the same as the team's and at least 1 foreign
          driver; for example the Alfa Romeo team in 1950 consisted of Italian drivers Giuseppe Farina, Luigi Fagioli and
          Piero Taruffi; and Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio.</p>

        <p>Alfa Romeo dominated all before them in the 1950 season, winning every race bar one in the championship with the
          pre-war "Alfetta" 158s. The sole exception was the Indianapolis 500, which was part of the championship, although
          not run to Formula One regulations and rarely contested by the European teams. The race would never be important
          for Formula One and was no longer part of the championship after 1960. Nino Farina won the inaugural championship,
          Juan Manuel Fangio taking it in 1951 with the Alfa-Romeo 159, an evolution of the 158. The Alfetta's engines were
          extremely powerful for their capacity: In 1951 the 159 engine was producing around 420 bhp (310 kW) but this was
          at the price of a fuel consumption of 125 to 175 litres per 100 km (2.26 to 1.61 mpg imp/1.88 mpg to 1.34 mpg US).
          Enzo Ferrari, who had raced the Alfettas before the war, and his engine designer Aurelio Lampredi, were the first
          to understand that the 1.5-litre supercharged engine was a dead end: Any increase in power meant more fuel to carry
          or more time lost in the pits for refuelling, For the last races of 1950 Ferrari sent his 1.5-litre supercharged
          125s to the museum, and fielded the new V12 4.5-litre normally aspirated 375s. With a fuel consumption of around
          35 litres per 100 kilometres (8.1 mpg‑imp; 6.7 mpg‑US) the 375s offered fierce opposition to the Alfettas towards
          the end of the 1951 season. Alfa Romeo, a state-owned company, decided to withdraw after a refusal of the Italian
          government to fund the expensive design of a new car. Surprisingly, Alfa Romeo involvement in racing was made with
          a very thin budget, using mostly pre-war technology and material during the two seasons. For instance the team
          won two championships using only nine pre-war built engine blocks.</p>

        <p>1958 was a watershed in another crucial way for Formula One. Against a small field of Ferraris and Maseratis, Stirling
          Moss won the Argentine Grand Prix driving a mid-engined Cooper entered by the private team of Rob Walker, and powered
          by a 2-litre Coventry-Climax Straight-4. This was the first victory for a car with the engine mounted behind the
          driver in Formula One.[note 2] The next Grand Prix in Monaco was also won by the same Cooper car, this time driven
          by Maurice Trintignant and facing more substantial opposition. Powered by undersized engines, the Coopers remained
          outsiders in 1958 but as soon as the new 2.5-litre Coventry-Climax engine was available, the little British cars
          went on to dominate Formula One. The 1959 season was effectively the start of the mid-engined revolution, and this
          season saw fierce competition between the works Cooper of Australian Jack Brabham and Moss in the Walker team's
          Cooper. The modified Citroën Traction Avant transaxle proved to be the Achilles heel of the Coopers, so Walker
          switched to a transaxle of proprietary design. The special transmission turned out to be more unreliable than the
          standard part, and Brabham took the title with Moss second.</p>

        <p>In 1962, the Lotus team ran the Lotus 25 powered by the new Coventry-Climax FWMV V8 engine. The car had an aluminium
          sheet monocoque chassis instead of the traditional spaceframe design. This proved to be the greatest technological
          breakthrough since the introduction of mid-engined cars, but the Lotus was unreliable at first. Jim Clark finished

        <p>As soon as the car and the engine became reliable, the era of the Lotus and of Jim Clark began. Clark won the title

          and the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race in the same year. For 1964 Lotus introduced the new Lotus 33 and Ferrari made
          considerable technological and financial effort to win the title. Ferrari used no less than three different engines
          in the season—the existing V6, a V8 and a flat-12, while Lotus was struggling with the teething troubles of a new
          car. The title went to John Surtees and Ferrari. Surtees' title was especially notable, as he became the only driver
          ever to win the World Championship for both cars and motorcycles. The 1965 Mexican Grand Prix, the last race of
          the 1.5 litres Formula One, saw Richie Ginther giving Honda its first victory at the end of a season that was otherwise
          disappointing for the Japanese newcomer. This was the first victory by a Japanese car and, as of today, the only

        <p>In 1968, Lotus lost its exclusive right to use the DFV. McLaren built a DFV-powered car and a new force appeared
          on the scene when Ken Tyrrell entered his team using Cosworth-powered French Matra chassis driven by ex-BRM Jackie
          Stewart as lead driver. Clark took his last win at the 1968 season opening South African Grand Prix. On 7 April
          1968 the double champion was killed at Hockenheim in a Formula Two event. The year saw two significant innovations.
          The first was the arrival of unrestricted sponsorship, which the FIA decided to permit after the withdrawal of
          support from automobile related firms. In May, the Lotus Formula One team appeared at Jarama in the red, gold and
          white colours of Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf brand. The second innovation was the introduction of wings as seen
          previously on the Chaparral CanAm and endurance cars. Colin Chapman started the arms race with modest front wings
          and a spoiler on Graham Hill's Lotus 49B at Monaco. Brabham and Ferrari went one better at the Belgian Grand Prix
          with full width wings mounted on struts high above the driver. Lotus replied with a full width wing directly connected
          to the rear suspension.[9] Brabham and Matra then produced a high mounted front wing connected to the front suspension.
          At the end of the season most cars were using mobile wings with various control systems. There was several case
          of wings, struts, or even suspension collapsing. Lotus won both titles in 1968 with Graham Hill with Stewart second.</p>

        <p>The 1983 title, won by Piquet for the Brabham team of Bernie Ecclestone, champion of the non-manufacturer teams'
          rights, was the first-ever won by a turbocharged engine. By 1983, the dispute between FISA and FOCA had been resolved
          and although FOCA emerged with the stronger hand, the teams had seen the writing on the wall. Renault had proven
          in 1979 and 1980 that turbo-charged engines were a more efficient means of getting more performance from the powertrain
          with the FIA regulations. The turbo cars were faster on almost all of the high speed (Hockenheim, Osterreichring,
          Monza, Silverstone) and high-altitude tracks (Interlagos, Kyalami), but by 1982, the turbo cars were fastest just
          about everywhere. The 1982 season made it obvious to all the competing Formula One teams that turbocharged engines
          were the way to go if anyone wanted to be competitive in Formula 1. By 1983, the reliability of the turbo-charged
          engines had been ironed out and made more reliable, and in 1984, only Tyrrell still struggled on with the old DFV
          engines. 1983 also saw the last non-championship Formula One race: The 1983 Race of Champions at Brands Hatch,
          won by reigning World Champion Keke Rosberg in a Williams-Ford/Cosworth in a close fight with American Danny Sullivan.</p>

        1,000 bhp (750 kW) dynamometer was incapable of measuring the output of their qualifying engines - Paul Rosche estimated

        <p>In 1989, turbos were banned and new regulations allowing only naturally aspirated engines up to 3.5 litres were put
          in their place. The dominance of McLaren-Honda continued for the next 3 seasons, Prost winning the title in 1989,
          Senna in 1990 and 1991. The V10 and V12 engines produced by the Japanese manufacturer proved to be just as good
          an engine as the turbo V6 before them, and the V10 was the best engine over the 2 seasons it was used and developed
          by McLaren and Honda. The championship was marred however by the fierce rivalry between the two men, culminating
          in a pair of clashes at the Japanese Grands Prix of 1989 and 1990. They both dominated Formula One from 1988 to
          1990, winning 37 of the 48 Grand Prix staged and each scoring almost twice as many points as the third-place driver
          in those championships. In 1989 Prost 'closed the door' on his overtaking teammate while Senna later freely admitted
          to deliberately driving into Prost in the 1990 race, drawing stiff condemnation from all quarters of Formula One.
          Senna, however, was more concerned with the threat (and opportunity) afforded by the resurgent Williams, now powered
          by Renault (the French giant's innovative engine technology allowed their engines to be level with Honda's engines)
          and designed by aerodynamics genius Adrian Newey which were to dominate Formula One for the next 7 years.</p>
        <p>It was more than Renault engines, however, which allowed Williams and later Benetton to dominate Formula One from
          1992 to 1997. Refuelling at pit stops was reintroduced turning each race into a series of sprints – as a result
          the race strategy became as important as the driver's ability. In the early 1990s, teams started introducing electronic
          driver aids, whose use spread rapidly. Active suspension, (pioneered by Lotus in 1987), semi-automatic gearboxes
          (Ferrari in 1989), and traction control (Williams in 1991) became essential to compete. Some of these technologies
          were borrowed from contemporary road cars. Others were primarily developed for the track and later made their way
          to the showroom. All enabled cars to reach higher and higher speeds, provided the teams were willing to spend the
          money. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill,
          banned many such aids in 1994. However, many observers felt that the ban on driver aids was a ban in name only
          as the FIA did not have the technology or the methods to eliminate these features from competition. Even this controversy
          did not diminish the pleasure British fans of the sport felt in 1992, when Nigel Mansell finally won the title,
          after a decade of trying, nor French fans in 1993 when Alain Prost took his 4th Championship, both drivers piloting
          Williams cars.</p>

        <p>By 1994, the previous death in Formula One was nearly a decade past, that of Elio de Angelis during testing at the
          Circuit Paul Ricard in 1986. There had been several horrifying accidents (for example Nelson Piquet and Gerhard
          Berger at Imola, or Martin Donnelly at Jerez), but no fatalities. The speed of Formula One cars had continuously
          risen over 8 years, despite turbocharged engines being made illegal, the width of tyres being reduced and driver
          aids eventually being removed. There was an "air of invincibility" in Formula One, a belief that the cars were
          inherently safe and no more drivers would die.</p>
        <p>At the San Marino Grand Prix weekend this belief was crushed completely with the serious injuries sustained by Rubens
          Barrichello in practice and the deaths of Roland Ratzenberger during qualifying and Ayrton Senna in the race on
          1 May 1994.[15] Furthermore, Karl Wendlinger was left comatose after a crash two weeks later at the Monaco Grand
          Prix.[16] The shock from the sudden injuries and deaths was stunning. Not only had two drivers been killed, but
          one of them was a triple world champion and arguably the best F1 driver at the time. The FIA reacted swiftly and
          harshly with major changes to be enforced from that year onwards, and it was the beginning of the FIA's push to
          increase safety in Formula One.</p>

        <p>However, by 1995 things had settled down somewhat. The downgraded 3-litre formula had no effect of the domination
          of the Renault V10, and Schumacher took his second Drivers' title, and Benetton their first Constructors' title,
          with relative ease, defeating the Williams team of Hill and David Coulthard. The Renault engine which powered both
          teams was virtually unbeatable, with only Ferrari claiming a single win at the Canadian Grand Prix for Alesi, his
          only career win.</p>
        <p>For 1996, the FIA mandated a much larger minimum size cockpit area, along with driver's head protection, to ensure
          the driver's head was less exposed (ironically, this limited driver visibility and contributed to accidents). As
          part of his plan to rebuild Ferrari, Jean Todt brought Michael Schumacher to the team from Benetton that year,
          essentially in exchange for his 1995 drivers Alesi and Berger. There was an immediate effect, in his first year
          with the Scuderia Schumacher won three races, more than the team had managed in the previous five years. Ferrari
          were not championship contenders though and Damon Hill made a strong run to the title, finally claiming the crown
          after 3 years of almost but not quite.</p>

        <p>After the banning of turbocharged engines in 1989, V10 became the most popular engine configuration in Formula One,
          because it offered the best compromise between power and fuel consumption. From the 1998 season onwards, all competing
          teams had V10 engines in their cars. V12s were powerful but thirsty, and vice versa for V8s. 2000 saw the grids
          of Formula One start to revert to normal, as Jordan rapidly faded out of sight, and Williams, looking forward to
          a new partnership with BMW started to reassert itself. The fight at the front, however, was very much between Häkkinen
          and Schumacher, each two-time champion, driving cars closely matched in performance. Ferrari had been steadily
          improving since their low point in the early 1990s and in 2000 Schumacher prevailed, becoming the first 3 time
          Champion since Senna, and bringing the World Drivers' title to Ferrari for the first time since Jody Scheckter
          in 1979. The 2001 season saw Ferrari start to leave the rest of the grid behind, and Schumacher won the championship
          by the Hungarian Grand Prix, which tied him as second quickest championship winner with Nigel Mansell. For 2002,
          the season was a red-wash. Ferrari finished every race, and won 15 of 17. Michael Schumacher scored more points
          than the second and third placed drivers combined, after gaining a podium in all of the races (Schumacher had only
          one third place in Malaysia). In this season, he wrapped up the championship at the French Grand Prix (Round 11
          of 17), becoming the earliest ever championship winner.</p>

        <p>In 2005, Formula One saw Ferrari and BAR rapidly fade out of sight, as the works Renault team dominated the early
          part of the season, and Fernando Alonso forged a clear championship lead. In the latter part of the season McLaren
          were significantly the stronger team, with consistently better results and a win tally of 6 from 7 races. However,
          their early record of poor reliability had meant that catching Renault in either Drivers' or Constructors' Championships
          was a tall order.</p>

      <p>For a while it looked close between Räikkönen and Alonso, but by Brazil Alonso had become Formula One's youngest ever
        champion. The Constructors' Championship looked even more likely for McLaren, widely regarded as the faster car and
        with reliability much improved. However, a retirement for Juan Pablo Montoya in the season finale at Shanghai secured
        the Constructors' title for Renault. One statistic proved the two teams' dominance: they together won all but one
        of the races, the controversial US Grand Prix, (in which neither of the two teams participated) which was Schumacher
        and Ferrari's only win of the year.</p>

        <p>Throughout the 2000s (decade), Formula One cars had become extremely complex, efficient and reliable, so much so
          that actual racing between drivers began to become less and less common. 2009 saw the introduction of many new
          rules and regulations (including engine rev limits, an adjustable front wing and disproportionate wing sizes) to
          encourage overtaking. Engines were revving up to 20,000 rpm and were initially limited to 19,000 rpm for 2009;
          but then this was lowered to 18,000 from 2010 to 2013.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col s12 m8 l8">
        <p>But the most significant system introduced in F1 was the Kinetic Energy Recovery System (KERS), a system that stores
          energy created by braking that is stored through a flywheel and this saved energy is then channeled to the car's
          drivetrain to increase acceleration. A few well funded teams had tested this technology the previous year but it
          was too experimental and all of the teams' KERS systems needed more development to the point where none of them
          would be ready for 2009. Due to the recession, many more rule changes were brought in to reduce the cost of Formula
          One. Initially a standardised engine was proposed, but this idea was rejected by the teams, who came up with their
          own cost-cutting measures. These included a huge reduction in testing times and an increase in the required engine
          and gearbox mileage. </p>

        <p>Formula One entered its second turbocharged era in 2014. Australia was the location of the end of the first era (Adelaide
          1988) and start of the second (Melbourne 2014). The series is being run under the most radical engine regulation
          changes since 1995. All cars entering any Formula One championship race must run with 1.6-litre single turbocharged
          6-cylinder engines with a rev limit of 15,000 rpm and maximum fuel flow of 100 kg/hr. New car regulations will
          also be enforced, and the minimum weight regulations will be raised from 642 kg (1,415 lb) to 690 kg (1,521 lb).
          Ferrari, Mercedes and Renault will be producing engines for this new formula; Cosworth did not participate from
          2014 and beyond. Honda returned to supplying McLaren with engines in 2015. In-season engine development will return;
          the previous V8's development was frozen. The new turbo engines are reckoned to produce 600 bhp (the previous V8s
          produce approximately 750 hp); but the new Energy Recovery System (ERS) will be twice as powerful as the current
          KERS system; this new ERS system will give the drivers up to the equivalent of 160 hp when activated; the current
          KERS gives cars an extra 80 hp when activated.</p>

      <p>Since the 2014 season, the Mercedes team and their drivers Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Valtteri Bottas have dominated
        the sport, winning all but 16 races (40 for Hamilton, 20 for Rosberg and 3 for Bottas). This astounding and historic
        winning streak has been the result of Mercedes development of the "split turbocharger", a system in which the compressor
        and turbine components of the turbo charger are placed at separate sides of the engine and connected by a rod running
        through the V of the engine. This new technology gave Mercedes and their customer teams many advantages over their
        competitors due to the need for less cooling and a more compact power unit. The only other drivers to win races during
        this period are Daniel Ricciardo (5) and Max Verstappen (3) of Red Bull, along with Sebastian Vettel (8) of Ferrari.</p>
